# Panel design

Your panel is a hypothesis list. Start broad, then tighten based on results.

## Tips

- Add likely pathogens for the syndrome and host species
- Add close relatives for each key organism to reduce mis-assignment
- Keep the panel sized for runtime and memory

## Taxon names

Use NCBI-recognized scientific names. This pipeline downloads references using the NCBI Datasets CLI.
